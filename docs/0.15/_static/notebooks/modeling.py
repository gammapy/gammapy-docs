# **TODO: write me! Does this contain a model gallery or do we move this to rst pages?**
# 
# This is a hands-on tutorial to `~gammapy.modeling`, showing examples how
# the model, dataset and fit classes work together, and how to define your
# own models and register them with Gammapy.
# 
# See also: `models.ipynb` (built-in model gallery) and `docs/modeling/index.rst`.
