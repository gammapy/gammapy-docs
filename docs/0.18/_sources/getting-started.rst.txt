Getting Started
===============

The best way to learn about Gammapy is to read and play with the examples in the
Gammapy :ref:`tutorials`.

This section explains the steps to get set up for the Gammapy tutorials on your
machine:

1. Check your setup and Gammapy environment
2. Use Gammapy with Python, IPython or Jupyter

If you have used conda, Python, IPython and Jupyter before, you can just skim
this page, and quickly copy & paste the commands to get set up.

Help!?
------

If you have any questions or issues, please ask for help on the Gammapy Slack,
mailing list or on Github (whatever is easiest for you, see `Gammapy contact`_)


Check your setup
----------------
You might want to display some info about Gammapy installed. You can execute
the following command, and it should print detailed information about your
installation to the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    gammapy info

If there is some issue, the following commands could help you to figure out
your setup:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda info
    which python
    which ipython
    which jupyter
    which gammapy
    env | grep PATH
    python -c 'import gammapy; print(gammapy); print(gammapy.__version__)'

You can also use the following commands to check which conda environment is active and which
ones you have set up:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda info
    conda env list

If you're new to conda, you could also print out the `conda cheat sheet`_, which
lists the common commands to install packages and work with environments.


Use Gammapy
-----------

Python
++++++

Gammapy is a Python package, so you can of course import and use it from Python:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python
    Python 3.6.0 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 10 2017, 07:08:35)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from gammapy.stats import CashCountsStatistic
    >>> CashCountsStatistic(n_on=10, mu_bkg=4.2).sqrt_ts
    array([2.39791813])

IPython
+++++++

IPython is nicer to use for interactive analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython
    Python 3.6.0 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 10 2017, 07:08:35)
    Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
    IPython 6.5.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

    In [1]: from gammapy.stats import CashCountsStatistic

    In [2]: CashCountsStatistic(n_on=10, mu_bkg=4.2).sqrt_ts
    Out[2]: array([2.39791813])

For example you can use ``?`` to look up **help for any Gammapy function, class or
method** from IPython:

.. code-block:: bash

    In [3]: CashCountsStatistic?

Of course, you can also use the Gammapy online docs if you prefer, clicking in links
(i.e. `gammapy.stats.CashCountsStatistic`) or using *search docs* field in the upper left.

As an example, here's how you can create `gammapy.data.DataStore` and
`gammapy.data.EventList` objects and start exploring H.E.S.S. data:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from gammapy.data import DataStore
    >>> data_store = DataStore.from_dir('$GAMMAPY_DATA/hess-dl3-dr1/')
    >>> events = data_store.obs(obs_id=23523).events
    >>> print(events)
    EventList info:
    - Number of events: 7613
    - Median energy: 0.953 TeV
    - OBS_ID = 23523
    >>> events.energy.mean()
    <Quantity 4.418008 TeV>

Try to make your first plot using the `gammapy.data.EventList.peek` helper method:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> events.peek()
    >>> plt.savefig("events.png")

Python script
+++++++++++++

Another common way to use Gammapy is to write a Python script.
Try it and put the following code into a file called ``example.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    """Example Python script using Gammapy"""
    from gammapy.data import DataStore
    data_store = DataStore.from_dir('$GAMMAPY_DATA/hess-dl3-dr1/')
    events = data_store.obs(obs_id=23523).events
    print(events.energy.mean())

You can run it with Python:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example.py
    4.418007850646973 TeV

If you want to continue with interactive data or results analysis after
running some Python code, use IPython like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython -i example.py

For examples how to run Gammapy analyses from Python scripts, see :ref:`tutorials_scripts`.


Jupyter notebooks
+++++++++++++++++

To learn more about Gammapy, and also for interactive data analysis in general,
we recommend you use Jupyter notebooks. Assuming you have followed the steps above to install Gammapy and activate the conda environment, you can start
`JupyterLab`_ like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jupyter lab

This should open up JupyterLab app in your web browser, where you can
create new Jupyter notebooks or open up existing ones. If you have downloaded the
tutorials with ``gammapy download tutorials``, you can browse your ``gammapy-tutorials``
folder with Jupyterlab and execute them there.

If you haven't used Jupyter before, try typing ``print("Hello Jupyter")`` in the
first input cell, and use the keyboard shortcut ``SHIFT + ENTER`` to execute it.

Install issues
--------------

If you have problems and think you might not be using the right Python or
importing Gammapy isn't working or giving you the right version, checking your
Python executable and import path might help you find the issue:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    print(sys.executable)
    print(sys.path)

To check which Gammapy you are using you can use this:

.. code-block:: python

    import gammapy
    print(gammapy)
    print(gammapy.__version__)

Now you should be all set and to use Gammapy. Let's move on to the
:ref:`tutorials`.
