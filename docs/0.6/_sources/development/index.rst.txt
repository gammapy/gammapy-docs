***********************
Developer documentation
***********************

The developer documentation is a collection of notes for Gammapy developers and maintainers.

If something is not covered here, have a look at the very extensive Astropy developer documentation
`here <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation>`__,
we do most things the same way.

But you don't have to read all this stuff if you want to contribute something to Gammapy.

We're happy to help out with any Gammapy-related questions or issues!

Just :ref:`talk to us <development-contact>`!
