Mask maps
=========

Create and apply masks maps.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Understanding of basic analyses in 1D or 3D.
-  Usage of `~regions` and catalogs, see the :doc:`catalog
   notebook </tutorials/api/catalog>`.

Context
-------

There are two main categories of masks in Gammapy for different use
cases. - Fitting often requires to ignore some parts of a reduced
dataset, e.g. to restrict the fit to a specific energy range or to
ignore parts of the region of interest that the user does not want to
model, or both. Gammapy’s `Datasets` therefore contain a `mask_fit`
sharing the same geometry as the data (i.e. `counts`). - During data
reduction, some background makers will normalize the background model
template on the data themselves. To limit contamination by real photons,
one has to exclude parts of the field-of-view where signal is expected
to be large. To do so, one needs to provide an exclusion mask. The
latter can be provided in a different geometry as it will be reprojected
by the `~gammapy.makers.Makers`.

We explain in more details these two types of masks below:

Masks for fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The region of interest used for the fit can defined through the dataset
`mask_fit` attribute. The `mask_fit` is a map containing boolean
values where pixels used in the fit are stored as True.

A spectral fit (1D or 3D) can be restricted to a specific energy range
where e.g. the background is well estimated or where the number of
counts is large enough. Similarly, 2D and 3D analyses usually require to
work with a wider map than the region of interest so sources laying
outside but reconstructed inside because of the PSF are correctly taken
into account. Then the `mask_fit` have to include a margin that take
into account the PSF width. We will show an example in the boundary mask
sub-section.

The `mask_fit` also can be used to exclude sources or complex regions
for which we don’t have good enough models. In that case the masking is
an extra security, it is preferable to include the available models
even if the sources are masked and frozen.

Note that a dataset contains also a `mask_safe` attribute that is
created and filled during data reduction. It is not to be modified
directly by users. The `mask_safe` is defined only from the options
passed to the `~gammapy.makers.SafeMaskMaker`.

Exclusion masks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background templates stored in the DL3 IRF are often not reliable enough
to be used without some corrections. A set of common techniques to
perform background or normalisation from the data is implemented in
gammapy: reflected regions for 1D spectrum analysis, field-of-view (FoV)
background or ring background for 2D and 3D analyses.

To avoid contamination of the background estimate from gamma-ray bright
regions these methods require to exclude those regions from the data
used for the estimation. To do so, we use exclusion masks. They are maps
containing boolean values where excluded pixels are stored as False.

Proposed approach
-----------------

Even if the use cases for exclusion masks and fit masks are different,
the way to create these masks is exactly the same, so in the following
we show how to work with masks in general:

- Creating masks from scratch
- Combining multiple masks
- Extending and reducing an existing mask
- Reading and writing masks

.. _masks-for-fitting:

Creating a mask for fitting
---------------------------

One can build a `mask_fit` to restrict the energy range of pixels used
to fit a `Dataset`. The mask being a `Map` it needs to use the same
geometry (i.e. a `Geom` object) as the `Dataset` it will be applied
to.

We show here how to proceed on a `MapDataset` taken from Fermi data
used in the 3FHL catalog. The dataset is already in the form of a
`Datasets` object. We read it from disk.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-132

.. code-block:: Python


    filename = "$GAMMAPY_DATA/fermi-3fhl-crab/Fermi-LAT-3FHL_datasets.yaml"
    datasets = Datasets.read(filename=filename)
    dataset = datasets["Fermi-LAT"]









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-136

We can check the default energy range of the dataset. In the absence of
a `mask_fit` it is equal to the safe energy range.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-140

    print(f"Fit range : {dataset.energy_range_total}")

 .. code-block:: none

    Fit range : (<Quantity 0.01 TeV>, <Quantity 2. TeV>)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 141-150

Create a mask in energy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We show first how to use a simple helper function
`~gammapy.maps.Geom.energy_range()`.

We obtain the `Geom` that is stored on the `counts` map inside the
`Dataset` and we can directly create the `Map`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 150-154

.. code-block:: Python


    mask_energy = dataset.counts.geom.energy_mask(10 * u.GeV, 700 * u.GeV)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 155-160

We can now set the dataset `mask_fit` attribute.

And we check that the total fit range has changed accordingly. The bin
edges closest to requested range provide the actual fit range.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 160-165

.. code-block:: Python

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 166-182

Mask some sky regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One might also exclude some specific part of the sky for the fit. For
instance, if one wants not to model a specific source in the region of
interest, or if one want to reduce the region of interest in the dataset
`Geom`.

In the following we restrict the fit region to a square around the Crab
nebula. **Note**: the dataset geometry is aligned on the galactic frame,
we use the same frame to define the box to ensure a correct alignment.
We can now create the map. We use the `WcsGeom.region_mask` method
putting all pixels outside the regions to False (because we only want to
consider pixels inside the region. For convenience, we can directly pass
a ds9 region string to the method:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 182-187

.. code-block:: Python


    regions = "galactic;box(184.55, -5.78, 3.0, 3.0)"
    mask_map = dataset.counts.geom.region_mask(regions)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 188-191

We can now combine this mask with the energy mask using the logical and
operator


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-195

Creating a mask manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are more familiar with the `Geom` and `Map` API, you can also
create the mask manually from the coordinates of all pixels in the
geometry. Here we simply show how to obtain the same behaviour as the
`energy_mask` helper method.

In practice, this allows to create complex energy dependent masks.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 214-220

.. code-block:: Python


    coords = dataset.counts.geom.get_coord()
    mask_data = (coords["energy"] >= 10 * u.GeV) & (coords["energy"] < 700 * u.GeV)
    mask_energy = Map.from_geom(dataset.counts.geom, data=mask_data)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-238

Creating an exclusion mask
--------------------------

Exclusion masks are typically used for background estimation to mask out
regions where gamma-ray signal is expected. An exclusion mask is usually
a simple 2D boolean `Map` where excluded positions are stored as
`False`. Their actual geometries are independent of the target
datasets that a user might want to build. The first thing to do is to
build the geometry.

Define the geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Masks are stored in `Map` objects. We must first define its geometry
and then we can determine which pixels to exclude. Here we consider a
region at the Galactic anti-centre around the crab nebula.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 238-243

.. code-block:: Python


    position = SkyCoord(83.633083, 22.0145, unit="deg", frame="icrs")
    geom = WcsGeom.create(skydir=position, width="5 deg", binsz=0.02, frame="galactic")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 244-262

Create the mask from a list of regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can build an exclusion mask from regions. We show here how to
proceed.

We can rely on known sources positions and properties to build a list of
regions (here `~regions.SkyRegions`) enclosing most of the signal that
our detector would see from these objects.

A useful function to create region objects is
`~regions.regions.parse`. It can take strings defining regions
e.g. following the “ds9” format and convert them to `regions`.

Here we use a region enclosing the Crab nebula with 0.3 degrees. The
actual region size should depend on the expected PSF of the data used.
We also add another region with a different shape as en example.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 262-268

.. code-block:: Python


    regions_ds9 = "galactic;box(185,-4,1.0,0.5, 45);icrs;circle(83.633083, 22.0145, 0.3)"
    regions = Regions.parse(regions_ds9, format="ds9")
    print(regions)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    [<RectangleSkyRegion(center=<SkyCoord (Galactic): (l, b) in deg
        (185., -4.)>, width=1.0 deg, height=0.5 deg, angle=45.0 deg)>, <CircleSkyRegion(center=<SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg
        (83.633083, 22.0145)>, radius=0.3 deg)>]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 269-272

Equivalently the regions can be read from a ds9 file, this time using
`Regions.read`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 272-276

.. code-block:: Python


    # regions = Regions.read('ds9.reg', format="ds9")









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 277-283

Create the mask map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can now create the map. We use the `WcsGeom.region_mask` method
putting all pixels inside the regions to False.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 283-290

.. code-block:: Python


    # to define the exclusion mask we take the inverse
    mask_map = ~geom.region_mask(regions)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 291-298

Create the mask from a catalog of sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also build our list of regions from a list of catalog sources.
Here we use the Fermi 4FGL catalog which we read using
`~gammapy.catalog.SourceCatalog`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 298-302

.. code-block:: Python


    fgl = CATALOG_REGISTRY.get_cls("4fgl")()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 303-306

We now select sources that are contained in the region we are interested
in.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 306-311

.. code-block:: Python


    inside_geom = geom.contains(fgl.positions)
    positions = fgl.positions[inside_geom]









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 312-316

We now create the list of regions using our 0.3 degree radius a priori
value. If the sources were extended, one would have to adapt the sizes
to account for the larger size.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 316-321

.. code-block:: Python


    exclusion_radius = Angle("0.3 deg")
    regions = [CircleSkyRegion(position, exclusion_radius) for position in positions]

Now we can build the mask map the same way as above.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 324-330

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 331-340

Create the mask from statistically significant pixels in a dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we want to determine an exclusion from the data directly. We will
estimate the significance of the data using the `ExcessMapEstimator`,
and exclude all pixels above a given threshold.

Here we use the `MapDataset` taken from the Fermi data used above.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 343-347

We apply a significance estimation. We integrate the counts using a
correlation radius of 0.4 degree and apply regular significance
estimate.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 347-352

.. code-block:: Python


    estimator = ExcessMapEstimator("0.4 deg", selection_optional=[])
    result = estimator.run(dataset)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 353-356

Finally, we create the mask map by applying a threshold of 5 sigma to
remove pixels.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 356-360

.. code-block:: Python


    significance_mask = result["sqrt_ts"] < 5.0









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 361-365

Because the `ExcessMapEstimator` returns NaN for masked pixels, we
need to put the NaN values to `True` to avoid incorrectly excluding
them.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 365-372

.. code-block:: Python


    invalid_pixels = np.isnan(result["sqrt_ts"].data)
    significance_mask.data[invalid_pixels] = True
    significance_mask.plot()
    plt.show()

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 373-386

This method frequently yields isolated pixels or weakly significant
features if one places the threshold too low.

To overcome this issue, one can use
`~skimage.filters.apply_hysteresis_threshold` . This filter allows to
define two thresholds and mask only the pixels between the low and high
thresholds if they are not continuously connected to a pixel above the
high threshold. This allows to better preserve the structure of the
excesses.

Note that scikit-image is not a required dependency of gammapy, you
might need to install it.

Masks operations
----------------

If two masks share the same geometry it is easy to combine them with
`Map` arithmetic.

OR condition is represented by `|` operator :

Boundary mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example we use the Fermi dataset previously loaded and
add its `mask_fit` taking into account a margin based on the psf
width. The margin width is determined using the `containment_radius`
method of the psf object and the mask is created using the
`boundary_mask` method available on the geometry object.
