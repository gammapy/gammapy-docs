        "## Context\n\n### 1. Bayesian analysis\n\nBayesian inference uses prior knowledge, in the form of a prior\ndistribution, in order to estimate posterior probabilities which we\ntraditionally visualise in the form of corner plots. These distributions\ncontain more information than a maximum likelihood fit as they reveal not\nonly the \u201cbest model\u201d but provide a more accurate representation of errors and\ncorrelation between parameters. In particular, non-Gaussian degeneracies are\ncomplex to estimate with a maximum likelihood approach.\n\n### 2. Limitations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach\n\nA well-known approach to estimate this posterior distribution is the\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This uses an ensemble of walkers to\nproduce a chain of samples that after a convergence period will reach a\nstationary state. *Once convergence* is reached, the successive elements\nof the chain are samples of the target posterior distribution. However,\nthe weakness of the MCMC approach lies in the \"*Once convergence*\" part.\nIf the walkers are started far from the best likelihood region, the convergence time can be\nlong or never reached if the walkers fall in a local minima. The choice\nof the initialisation point can become critical for complex models with\na high number of dimensions and the ability of these walkers to escape a\nlocal minimum or to accurately describe a complex likelihood space is\nnot guaranteed.\n\n### 3. Nested sampling approach\n\nTo overcome these issues, the nested sampling (NS) algorithm has\ngained traction in physics and astronomy. It is a Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for computing an integral of the likelihood function over\nthe prior model parameter space introduced in\n[Skilling, 2004](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AIPC..735..395S)_.\nThe method performs this integral by evolving a collection of points\nthrough the parameter space (see recent reviews from [Ashton et al.,\n2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NRvMP...2...39A)_, and\n[Buchner, 2023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09675)_). Without going\ninto too many details, one important specificity of the NS method is\nthat it starts from the entire parameter space and evolves a\ncollection of live points to map all minima (including multiple modes\nif any), whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods require an\ninitialisation point and the walkers will explore the local\nlikelihood. The ability of these walkers to escape a local minimum or\nto accurately describe a complex likelihood space is not guaranteed.\nThis is a fundamental difference with MCMC or Minuit which will\nonly ever probe the vicinity along their minimisation paths and do not\nhave an overview of the global likelihood landscape. The analysis\nusing the NS framework is more CPU time consuming than a standard\nclassical fit, but it provides the full posterior distribution for all\nparameters, which is out of reach with traditional fitting techniques\n(N*(N-1)/2 contour plots to generate). In addition, it is more robust\nto the choice of initialisation, requires less human intervention and\nis therefore readily integrated in pipeline analysis. In Gammapy, we\nused the NS implementation of the UltraNest package\n(see [here](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/)_ for more information), one of the\nleading package in Astronomy (already used in Cosmology and in\nX-rays).\nFor a nice visualisation of the NS method see here : [sampling\nvisualisation](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/method.html#visualisation)_.\nAnd for a tutorial of UltraNest applied to X-ray fitting with concrete examples and questions see : [BXA\nTutorial](https://peterboorman.com/tutorial_bxa.html)_.\n\n\n**Note: please cite UltraNest if used for a paper**\n\nIf you are using the \"UltraNest\" library for a paper, please follow its citation scheme:\n[Cite UltraNest](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/issues.html#how-should-i-cite-ultranest)_.\n\n\n\n"

        "## Defining the sampler and options\n\nAs for the `~gammapy.modeling.Fit` object, the `~gammapy.modeling.Sampler` object can receive\ndifferent backend (although just one is available for now).\nThe `~gammapy.modeling.Sampler` comes with \u201creasonable\u201d default parameters, but you can\nchange them via the `sampler_opts` dictionnary.\nHere is a short description of the most relevant parameters that you\ncould change :\n\n-  `live_points`: minimum number of live points throughout the run.\n   More points allow to discover multiple peaks if existing, but is\n   slower. To test the Prior boundaries and for debugging, a lower\n   number (~100) can be used before a production run with more points\n   (~400 or more).\n-  `frac_remain`: the cut-off condition for the integration, set by the maximum\n   allowed fraction of posterior mass left in the live points vs the dead points. High\n   values (e.g., 0.5) are faster and can be used if the posterior\n   distribution is a relatively simple shape. A low value (1e-1, 1e-2)\n   is optimal for finding peaks, but slower.\n-  `log_dir`: directory where the output files will be stored.\n   If set to None, no files will be written. If set to a string, a directory\n   will be created containing the ongoing status of the run and final results.\n   For time consuming analysis, it is highly recommended to use that option to monitor\n   the run and restart it in case of a crash (with `resume=True`).\n\n**Important note:** unlike the MCMC method, you don\u2019t need to define the\nnumber of steps for which the sampler will run. The algorithm will\nautomatically stop once a convergence criteria has been reached.\n\n\n"
