Estimation of time variability in a lightcurve
==============================================

Compute a series of time variability significance estimators for a lightcurve.

Prerequisites
-------------

Understanding the light curve estimator, please refer to the :doc:`/tutorials/analysis-time/light_curve` tutorial.
For more in-depth explanation on the creation of smaller observations for exploring time variability, refer to the
:doc:`/tutorials/analysis-time/light_curve_flare` tutorial.

Context
-------
Frequently, after computing a lightcurve, we need to quantify its variability in the time domain, for example
in the case of a flare, burst, decaying light curve in GRBs or heightened activity in general.

There are many ways to define the significance of the variability.

**Objective: Estimate the level time variability in a lightcurve through different methods.**

Proposed approach
-----------------

We will start by reading the pre-computed light curve for PKS 2155-304 that is stored in `$GAMMAPY_DATA`
To learn how to compute such an object, see the :doc:`/tutorials/analysis-time/light_curve_flare` tutorial.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to compute different estimates which measure the significance of variability.
These estimators range from basic ones that calculate the peak-to-trough variation, to more complex ones like
fractional excess and point-to-point fractional variance, which consider the entire light curve. We also show an
approach which utilises the change points in Bayesian blocks as indicators of variability.

Methods to characterize variability
-----------------------------------

The three methods shown here are:

-  amplitude maximum variation
-  relative variability amplitude
-  variability amplitude.

The amplitude maximum variation is the simplest method to define variability (as described in
`Boller et al., 2016 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A&A...588A.103B/abstract>`__)
as it just computes
the level of tension between the lowest and highest measured fluxes in the lightcurve.
This estimator requires fully Gaussian errors.

    f_max = flux.max()
    f_max_err = flux_err[flux.argmax()]
    f_min = flux.min()
    f_min_err = flux_err[flux.argmin()]

    amplitude_maximum_variation = (f_max - f_max_err) - (f_min + f_min_err)

    amplitude_maximum_significance = amplitude_maximum_variation / np.sqrt(

There are other methods based on the peak-to-trough difference to assess the variability in a lightcurve.
Here we present as example the relative variability amplitude as presented in
`Kovalev et al., 2004 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/497430>`__:

        / (f_max + f_min) ** 2
    )

Fractional excess variance, point-to-point fractional variance and doubling/halving time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fractional excess variance, as presented by
`Vaughan et al., 2003 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.345.1271V/abstract>`__, is a simple but effective
method to assess the significance of a time variability feature in an object, for example an AGN flare.
It is important to note that it requires Gaussian errors to be applicable.
The excess variance computation is implemented in `~gammapy.estimators.utils`.

A similar estimator is the point-to-point fractional variance, as defined by
`Edelson et al., 2002 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...568..610E/abstract>`__,
which samples the lightcurve on smaller time granularity.
In general, the point-to-point fractional variance being higher than the fractional excess variance is indicative
of the presence of very short timescale variability.

The characteristic doubling and halving time of the light curve, as introduced by
`Brown, 2013 <https://durham-repository.worktribe.com/output/1478453/>`__, can also be computed.
This provides information on the shape of the variability feature, in particular how quickly it rises and falls.

Bayesian blocks
---------------
The presence of temporal variability in a lightcurve can be assessed by using bayesian blocks
(`Scargle et al., 2013 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...764..167S/abstract>`__).
A good and simple-to-use implementation of the algorithm is found in
`astropy.stats.bayesian_blocks`.
This implementation uses Gaussian statistics, as opposed to the `first introductory paper <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/306064>`__
which is based on Poissonian statistics.

By passing the flux and error on the flux as ``measures`` to the method we can obtain the list of optimal bin edges
defined by the bayesian blocks algorithm.

.. code-block:: Python


    time = lc_1d.geom.axes["time"].time_mid.mjd

    bayesian_edges = bayesian_blocks(

    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 193-195

The result giving a significance estimation for variability in the lightcurve is the number of *change points*,
i.e. the number of internal bin edges: if at least one change point is identified by the algorithm, there is significant variability.

We can rebin the lightcurve to compute the one expected with bayesian edges
First, we adjust the first and last bins of the bayesian_edges to coincide
with the original light curve start and end points.
