CTA with Gammapy
================

Access and inspect CTA data and instrument response functions (IRFs) using Gammapy.

Introduction
------------

The `Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA) <https://www.cta-observatory.org/>`__ is the next generation
ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy. Gammapy is the core
library for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) science tools
(`2017ICRC…35..766D <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ICRC...35..766D>`__
and `CTAO Press
Release <https://www.cta-observatory.org/ctao-adopts-the-gammapy-software-package-for-science-analysis/>`__).

CTA will start taking data in the coming years. For now, to learn how to
analyse CTA data and to use Gammapy, if you are a member of the CTA
consortium, you can use the simulated dataset from the CTA first data
challenge which ran in 2017 and 2018.

-  https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/data-challenge-1-dc-1/wiki (CTA
   internal)

Gammapy fully supports the FITS data formats (events, IRFs) used in CTA
1DC. The XML sky model format is not supported, but are also not needed
to analyse the data, you have to specify your model via the Gammapy YAML
model format, or Python code, as shown below.

You can use Gammapy to simulate CTA data and evaluate CTA performance
using the CTA response files available here:

-  https://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/

The current FITS format `CTA-Performance-prod3b-v2-FITS.tar` is fully
supported by Gammapy, as shown below.

Tutorial overview
-----------------

This notebook shows how to access CTA data and instrument response
functions (IRFs) using Gammapy, and gives some examples how to quick
look the content of CTA files, especially to see the shape of CTA IRFs.

At the end of the notebooks, we give several links to other tutorial
notebooks that show how to simulate CTA data and how to evaluate CTA
observability and sensitivity, or how to analyse CTA data.

Note that the FITS data and IRF format currently used by CTA is the one
documented at https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/, and is
also used by H.E.S.S. and other imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs). So if you see other Gammapy tutorials using e.g. H.E.S.S.
example data, know that they also apply to CTA, all you have to do is to
change the loaded data or IRFs to CTA.

CTA 1DC
-------

The CTA first data challenge (1DC) ran in 2017 and 2018. It is described
in detail
`here <https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/data-challenge-1-dc-1/wiki>`__
and a description of the data and how to download it is
`here <https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/data-challenge-1-dc-1/wiki#Data-access>`__.

You should download `caldb.tar.gz` (1.2 MB), `models.tar.gz` (0.9
GB), `index.tar.gz` (0.5 MB), as well as optionally the simulated
survey data you are interested in: Galactic plane survey `gps.tar.gz`
(8.3 GB), Galactic center `gc.tar.gz` (4.4 MB), Extragalactic survey
`egal.tar.gz` (2.5 GB), AGN monitoring `agn.wobble.tar.gz` (4.7 GB).
After download, follow the instructions how to `untar` the files, and
set a `CTADATA` environment variable to point to the data.

For convenience, since the 1DC data files are large, and not publicly
available to anyone, we have taken a tiny subset of the CTA 1DC data,
four observations with the southern array from the GPS survey, pointing
near the Galactic center, and included them at `$GAMMAPY_DATA/cta-1dc`
which you get via `gammapy download tutorials`.

Files
~~~~~

Next we will show a quick overview of the files and how to load them,
and some quick look plots showing the shape of the CTA IRFs. How to do
CTA simulations and analyses is shown in other tutorials, see links at
the end of this notebook.

Events
------

We can load events data via the data store and observation, or
equivalently via the `~gammapy.data.EventList` class by specifying the
EVENTS filename.

The quick-look `events.peek()` plot below shows that CTA has a field
of view of a few degrees, and two energy thresholds, one significantly
below 100 GeV where the CTA large-size telescopes (LSTs) detect events,
and a second one near 100 GeV where the mid-sized telescopes (MSTs)
start to detect events.

Note that most events are “hadronic background” due to cosmic ray
showers in the atmosphere that pass the gamma-hadron selection cuts for
this analysis configuration. Since this is simulated data, column
`MC_ID` is available that gives an emission component identifier code,
and the EVENTS header in `events.table.meta` can be used to look up
which `MC_ID` corresponds to which emission component.

IRFs
----

The CTA instrument response functions (IRFs) are given as FITS files in
the `caldb` folder, the following IRFs are available:

-  effective area
-  energy dispersion
-  point spread function
-  background

Notes:

-  The IRFs contain the energy and offset dependence of the CTA response
-  CTA 1DC was based on an early version of the CTA FITS responses
   produced in 2017, improvements have been made since.
-  The point spread function was approximated by a Gaussian shape
-  The background is from hadronic and electron air shower events that
   pass CTA selection cuts. It was given as a function of field of view
   coordinates, although it is radially symmetric.
-  The energy dispersion in CTA 1DC is noisy at low energy, leading to
   unreliable spectral points for some analyses.
-  The CTA 1DC response files have the first node at field of view
   offset 0.5 deg, so to get the on-axis response at offset 0 deg,
   Gammapy has to extrapolate. Furthermore, because diffuse gamma-rays
   in the FOV were used to derive the IRFs, and the solid angle at small
   FOV offset circles is small, the IRFs at the center of the FOV are
   somewhat noisy. This leads to unstable analysis and simulation issues
   when using the DC1 IRFs for some analyses.

Source models
-------------

The 1DC sky model is distributed as a set of XML files, which in turn
link to a ton of other FITS and text files. Gammapy doesn’t support this
XML model file format. We are currently developing a YAML based format
that improves upon the XML format, to be easier to write and read, add
relevant information (units for physical quantities), and omit useless
information (e.g. parameter scales in addition to values).

If you must or want to read the XML model files, you can use
e.g. `ElementTree <https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html>`__
from the Python standard library, or
`xmltodict <https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict>`__ if you
`pip install xmltodict`. Here’s an example how to load the information
for a given source, and to convert it into the sky model format Gammapy
understands.

CTA performance files
---------------------

CTA 1DC is useful to learn how to analyse CTA data. But to do
simulations and studies for CTA now, you should get the most recent CTA
IRFs in FITS format from
https://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/

If you want to run the download and examples in the next code cells,

Exercises
---------

-  Load the EVENTS file for `obs_id=111159` as a
   `~gammapy.data.EventList` object.
-  Use `events.table` to find the energy, sky coordinate and time of
   the highest-energy envent.
-  Use `events.pointing_radec` to find the pointing position of this
   observation, and use `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` methods to find
   the field of view offset of the highest-energy event.
-  What is the effective area and PSF 68% containment radius of CTA at 1
   TeV for the `South_z20_50h` configuration used for the CTA 1DC
   simulation?
-  Get the latest CTA FITS performance files from
   https://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/ and run the
   code example above. Make an effective area ratio plot of 40 deg
   zenith versus 20 deg zenith for the `South_z40_50h` and
   `South_z20_50h` configurations.
